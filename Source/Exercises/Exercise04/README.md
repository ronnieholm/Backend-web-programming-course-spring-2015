# Exercise 4: Bank account

Consider the problem of representing properties of a 
bank account. 
 
1. Come up with as many relevant properties for a bank account 
   that you can think of (to get you started: name of account 
   holder, bank account number, ...) 
2. Declare variables in code to represent these properties. 
   Remember to (a) choose a good name for each variable and (b) choose 
   a suitable type for each variable 
3. Following the variable declarations, assign proper 
   values to each variable and make sure to check your 
   code can actually compile (hit F6 and make sure there're no errors)
