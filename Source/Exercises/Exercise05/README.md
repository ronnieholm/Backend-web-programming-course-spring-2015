# Exercise 5: Arithmetic expressions I

The code contains eight arithmetic expressions. For each one, 
try to figure out what the value of the variable is. When 
ready, see the result by uncommenting the statement that 
prints the value of the variable. 

Statements are uncommented by removing the initial pair 
of slashes: 
 
Change

    // Console.WriteLine("The value of a is : {0}", a); 

to 

    Console.WriteLine("The value of a is : {0}", a); 
 
and likewise for subsequent cases. 
 
The program is run by pressing F5 or clicking the small 
green triangle in the menu bar.
