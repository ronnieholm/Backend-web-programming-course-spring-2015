# Exercise 15: Bank account class definition

This exercise is about defining a new class yourself. Included in this project
is a file called BankAccount.cs, containing an empty definition of a BankAccount
class.

You have to copy and fill out this class definition. The requirements for the bank 
account class are as follows:

  - It must have a name which is the name of the account holder
  - It must have a balance which is a decimal number
  - It must have a Deposit method which you can use for depositing an amount
    to the account, i.e., balance should be increased
  - It must have a Withdraw method which you can use for withdrawing an amount
    from the account, i.e., balance should be decreased
  - It must have methods for returning the value of the account holder name 
    and balance (one method for each value)

Given these requirement, your tasks are:

1. Fill out the BankAccount definition such that all requirements are 
   fulfilled. This includes the definition of instance fields, constructors,
   and methods.
2. Write test code to exercise your BankAccount class, i.e., you should 
   create a BankAccount object, call the withdraw/deposit methods, and use 
   available methods to check that the object behaves as expected with regard
   to the value of the balance.
3. If you have time, try to extend the class definition with methods  for adding
   interest to the account. It's up to you to define requirements for interest.

This is a large and somewhat difficult exercise. Try to solve it in small steps. 
Get one part to work, test it, and then proceed to the next one. In short, manage 
the complexity.
