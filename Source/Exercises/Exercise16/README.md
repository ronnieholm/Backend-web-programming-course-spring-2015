# Exercise 16: Geometry

This exercise is about defining a class from scratch. Included in the project is a file called Geometry.cs 
containing an empty definition of a class Geometry.

You must fill out the class definition. The requirements for the Geometry class are as following (use 
Google if you cannot remember the geometrical definitions):

  - Given the two side lengths of a rectangle, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle
  - Given the two side lengths of a rectangle, calculate the area of the rectangle
  - Given the radius of a circle, calculate the area of the circle
  - Given the four angles of a polygon with four sides, determine if the polygon is a rectangle 
    (what conditions must the angles fulfill?)

Given these requirements your tasks are:

1. Fill out the Geometry definition such that all requirements are fulfilled. This includes 
   the definition of instance fields (are any needed?), constructors, and methods.
2. Write test code to exercise your Geometry class, i.e., create a Geometry object, call
   its methods, and check the results against manually calculated results.
3. If you have time left, try to extend the class definition with various interesting geometric 
   methods. It is up to you to define the requirements.

This is a large and somewhat difficult exercise. Try to solve it in small steps. 
Get one part to work, test it, and then proceed to the next one. In short, manage 
the complexity.
