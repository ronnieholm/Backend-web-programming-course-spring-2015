# Exercise 25: For loops

This exercise is about predicting the outcome of a couple of for loops and 
then to try to change a few while loops into for loops.

  1. In the ForLoops.cs file, two cases of for loops (case 1-2) have 
     been implemented. Try to figure out what the output from each loop is. 
	 When ready, uncomment the line in each loop which prints the current 
	 value of the variable,and see if you were right.
  2. The code also contains two while loops (case 3-4). Run the program to 
     see what the output from each is. Now change each while loop into 
	 an equivalent for loop, i.e., a for loop producing the same output.
