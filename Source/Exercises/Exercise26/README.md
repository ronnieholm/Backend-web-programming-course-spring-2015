# Exercise 26: Draw shapes

This exercise is about trying to draw simple shapes on screen
using for loops. A simple DrawingTool class is provided to help 
the task.

  1. Study the DrawingTool class. As you can tell it's faily simple. 
     Are there any good reason to have such a class at all?
  2. Using for loops and the DrawingTool class, see if you can draw the 
     following five simple shapes on screen (they become gradually
	 harder, though).

Shape A (10 stars in a row).

Shape B (5 stars in a row, separated by spaces).
* * * * * 

Shape C (10 rows of 10 stars each).
