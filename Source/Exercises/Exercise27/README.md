# Exercise 27: Math library

This exercise is about implementing a few math functions
using loops.

The project contains a MathLibrary class which contains four 
methods for various calculations:

  - Faculty
  - IntervalSum
  - HighestSquareBelowLimit
  - IsPrime

The method declarations are already there but their bodies need to be 
completed. The purpose of each method is described in detail in the 
class definition itself. In the runner class code has been added 
to test the correctness of the methods.
 
  1. Implement the Faculty method  and use the test to check that 
     it works as expected.
  2. Implement the method IntervalSum and use the test to check 
     that it works as expected.
  3. Implement the method HighestSquareBelowLimit and use the test 
     to check that it works as expected.
  4. Implement the method IsPrime and use the test to check that 
     it works as expected (NB: Difficult).
