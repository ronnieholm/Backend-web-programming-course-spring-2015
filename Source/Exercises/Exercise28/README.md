# Exercise 28: Introducing lists

This exercise is about predicting the result of calling methods
on the List object and about writing code to use a List object.

  1. In the ListExamples class a List object is created and 
     elements are added and removed from the list. At four points 
	 in the code (case 1-4), you must predict the outcome of the 
	 WriteLine statement. When ready, uncomment the WriteLine 
	 statement and see if your prediction was correct.
  2. Following the cases above, four more cases are given (case 
     5-8) where you must write code that use the List object to 
	 retrieve various information about the elements in the list. 
	 Details for each case are given as comments in the code.
